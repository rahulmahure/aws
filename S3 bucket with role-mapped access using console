S3 bucket with role-mapped access using console

steps to create an S3 bucket with role-mapped access using the AWS Management Console:

Step 1: Create an IAM Role

Go to the IAM service in the AWS Management Console.
Click on "Roles" in the left navigation pane.
Click on "Create role" to start creating a new IAM role.
Select the service that will use this role (in this case, choose "S3") and click "Next: Permissions".
In the "Attach permissions policies" step, search for and select the policies you want to attach to the role (e.g., "AmazonS3FullAccess").
Click "Next: Tags" to optionally add tags to the role.
Click "Next: Review".
Provide a name for the role (e.g., "s3-access-role") and an optional description.
Click "Create role" to create the IAM role.

Step 2: Create the S3 Bucket

Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
Click on "Create bucket" to start creating a new S3 bucket.
Provide a unique bucket name and select the desired AWS region.
Click "Next" to proceed to the "Configure options" step.
(Optional) Configure additional settings such as versioning, logging, and tags for the bucket.
Click "Next" to proceed to the "Set permissions" step.

Step 3: Map the IAM Role to the Bucket

In the "Set permissions" step of the S3 bucket creation process, expand the "Manage system permissions" section.
Click "Edit" next to "Bucket policy".
In the bucket policy editor, add the following policy statement:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "GrantAccessToRole",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:role/s3-access-role"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:CreateBucket",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:GetObjectAcl",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME",
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Replace "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" with your AWS account ID and "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME" with the name of the S3 bucket you created in Step 2.

Click "Save changes" to apply the bucket policy.
That's it! You have now created an S3 bucket with role-mapped access using the AWS Management Console. 
The specified IAM role will have the necessary permissions to create, read, and update files in the bucket.
